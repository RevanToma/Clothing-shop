# Description

<p> I recently been doing a React course from Udemy where I developed a fully functional clothing shop project. My journey began by learning the fundamentals of React and getting familiar with the JavaScript library. During this process, I completed challenges to help me understand the concepts equally as well as improving my coding ability. Afterwards, I practiced different techniques for implanting the React's components, learnt about styling those components and even expanded my knowledge about different external packages. Utilizing these tools, the goal is to create a complete web-based application from scratch to finish. By the end, I will have a deep understanding of React as a whole and will be confident in my ability to build a functional React application.
